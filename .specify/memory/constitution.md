# AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Technical Accuracy & Scientific Rigor
All technical content must be grounded in established robotics, AI, and simulation standards. 
Content must align with industry-leading frameworks including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and OpenAI Agents SDK. 
All implementations must be validated against real-world physics and robotics principles.

### II. Clarity for Advanced Technical Audience
All content must be accessible and comprehensible to readers with AI, robotics, and computer science backgrounds. 
Explanations must be precise and thorough, with clear connections between theoretical concepts and practical implementations.

### III. Reproducibility & Verification
Every code example, simulation setup, and architectural decision must be fully reproducible. 
All implementations must include runnable code, detailed comments, and step-by-step reproduction guides. 
Results must be verifiable across different environments.

### IV. AI-Native Development & Spec-Driven Workflows
All content creation and software development must leverage AI-assisted tools and follow Spec-Kit Plus driven methodologies. 
Documentation-first approach is mandatory for all features and architectural decisions.

### V. Theory-Practice Alignment
Strong alignment between theoretical concepts, simulations, and practical implementations is required. 
Each theoretical concept must be demonstrated through practical examples, and all practical implementations 
must be grounded in theoretical foundations.

### VI. Modularity & Extensibility
Both content and software components must follow modular, extensible design principles. 
Each module should be independently usable and extendable, supporting easy addition of new robotics capabilities 
and AI techniques.

## Standards & Requirements

All technical explanations must align with established frameworks (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, OpenAI Agents SDK). 
Code examples must be runnable, well-commented, and reproducible. Architectural decisions must be justified and 
traceable with clear rationales documented in ADRs. Terminology must be consistent across chapters and modules. 
Documentation-first approach using Spec-Kit Plus is mandatory. Clear separation between conceptual explanations 
and implementation details must be maintained.

## Development Workflow

Content and software development follows Docusaurus-based publishing workflow with GitHub Pages deployment. 
RAG chatbot integration using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI backend, Qdrant Cloud vector storage, 
and Neon Serverless Postgres for metadata. Module-based curriculum structure covering robotic nervous systems, 
digital twins, AI-robot brains, and vision-language-action systems.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project. 
All contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments require formal documentation and 
project maintainer approval with clear migration plans for affected components.
