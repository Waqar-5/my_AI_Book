This is a placeholder file for the voice architecture diagram. In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:

Voice-to-Action Architecture:
- Microphone Input
- OpenAI Whisper Speech Recognition
- Voice Command Processing
- Intent Classification
- Entity Extraction
- Robot Action Mapping
- ROS 2 Action Execution
- Voice Feedback System

The diagram would illustrate how these components interact in the voice-to-action system.
