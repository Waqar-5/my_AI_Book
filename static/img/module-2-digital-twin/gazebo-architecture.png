This is a placeholder file for the Gazebo Architecture diagram. In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:

Gazebo Physics Simulation Architecture:
- Humanoid Robot Model (URDF)
- Physics Engine (ODE/Bullet)  
- Collision Detection System
- Environment Models
- Sensor Simulations
- ROS 2 Interface
- Control Systems

The diagram would illustrate how these components interact in the simulation environment.
