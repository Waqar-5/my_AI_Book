This is a placeholder file for the Unity Architecture diagram. In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:

Unity Visualization Architecture:
- Gazebo Physics Engine
- State Bridge/ROS Bridge
- Unity Rendering Engine
- Visual Assets and Materials
- Human-Robot Interaction Interface
- Synchronization Layer

The diagram would illustrate how these components interact in the visualization system.
