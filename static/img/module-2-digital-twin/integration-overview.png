This is a placeholder file for the Integration Overview diagram. In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:

Integration Overview:
- Gazebo Physics Simulation
- Unity Visualization
- Sensor Simulation (LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU)
- State Bridge/Synchronization
- ROS Integration
- AI Perception Pipelines
- Human-Robot Interaction

The diagram would illustrate how all components work together in the complete digital twin system.
