This is a placeholder file for the Sensor Simulation Architecture diagram. In a real implementation, this would be a PNG image showing:

Sensor Simulation Architecture:
- LiDAR Simulation (Gazebo ray sensors)
- Depth Camera Simulation (Gazebo depth sensors)  
- IMU Simulation (Gazebo IMU sensors)
- Data Processing Pipeline
- AI Perception Systems
- Ground Truth Generation
- Validation Framework

The diagram would illustrate how these components interact in the sensor simulation system.
