# Isaac Sim Basic Scene
# File: basic-scene.usd

# This is a placeholder USD file that represents a basic Isaac Sim scene
# In a real implementation, this would contain detailed USD specifications
# for a 3D scene with robots, environments, and sensors

# The actual content would include:
# - Robot model (humanoid)
# - Environment (with obstacles, lighting)
# - Sensors (RGB camera, LiDAR, IMU)
# - Physics properties
# - Materials and textures

# Example simplified structure:
# primPath = "/World"
#   addChildren = [
#     "/World/Robot",
#     "/World/Environment",
#     "/World/Light",
#   ]

# This file would be properly formatted USD/Z with Isaac Sim specifications
