# Isaac Sim High-Fidelity Environment Model
# File: hfi-environment.usd

# This is a placeholder USD file that represents a high-fidelity Isaac Sim environment
# In a real implementation, this would contain detailed USD specifications
# for a realistic 3D environment with accurate physics and rendering properties

# The actual content would include:
# - Complex scene geometry with high-poly models
# - Advanced materials with realistic properties
# - Physically accurate lighting and shadows
# - Detailed textures with PBR properties
# - Accurate environmental physics (friction, restitution, etc.)

# Example simplified structure:
# over "props/Environment" (
#     prepend references = @environments/complex-indoor-room.usda@
# )
# {
#     # Material assignments
#     materialBindings = [
#         # Various realistic materials
#     ]
#     
#     # Physics properties
#     physics:rigidBodyEnabled = true
#     physics:kinematicEnabled = false
#     
#     # Visual properties
#     visibility = "inherited"
# }

# This file would be properly formatted USD/Z with Isaac Sim specifications
# for high-fidelity rendering and physics simulation
