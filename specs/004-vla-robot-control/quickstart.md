# Quickstart: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robots

## Overview

This quickstart guide will help you get up and running with the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, focusing on the foundational concepts needed to combine vision, language, and action for autonomous humanoid behavior using LLM-driven planning.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of Large Language Models
- Understanding of digital twins (covered in Module 2)
- Access to Docusaurus for viewing documentation

## Learning Path

### Step 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces (Priority: P1)
1. Read Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces
2. Learn about speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper
3. Understand mapping voice commands to robot intents
4. Experiment with voice-to-intent classification

### Step 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs (Priority: P2)
1. Read Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs
2. Learn how to translate natural language into ROS 2 action sequences
3. Understand task decomposition and execution flow
4. Experiment with LLM-based planning

### Step 3: Capstone - The Autonomous Humanoid (Priority: P3)
1. Read Chapter 3: Capstone - The Autonomous Humanoid
2. Implement the end-to-end VLA pipeline
3. Integrate perception, navigation, and manipulation in simulation
4. Create a complete autonomous humanoid workflow

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the Vision-Language-Action paradigm
- Explain voice-to-command and LLM-based planning concepts
- Understand the full autonomous humanoid workflow

## Next Steps

1. Complete all hands-on exercises (estimated 4-6 hours)
2. Verify that you can reproduce all minimal examples
3. Explore advanced topics in the related modules
4. Apply these concepts to your own humanoid robot projects
