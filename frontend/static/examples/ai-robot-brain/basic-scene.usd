# Isaac Sim Basic Scene File
# File: basic-scene.usd

# This is a simplified USD file to represent a basic Isaac Sim scene
# In a real implementation, this would contain detailed USD specifications
# for a 3D scene with humanoid robot models, environments, and sensors

# The actual content would include:
# - Robot model (humanoid) with proper joint definitions
# - Environment (with obstacles, lighting)
# - Sensors (camera, LiDAR, IMU)
# - Physics properties
# - Materials and textures

# Example simplified structure:
# def Xform "World"
# {
#    def Xform "Robot"
#    {
#        # Robot model with links and joints
#    }
#    
#    def Xform "Environment"
#    {
#        # Environment objects
#    }
#    
#    def Xform "Sensors"
#    {
#        # Sensor definitions
#    }
# }

# This file would be properly formatted USD with Isaac Sim specifications
