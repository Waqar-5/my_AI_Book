# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## An AI-Native Journey from Digital Intelligence to Embodied Action

Welcome to **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, a spec-driven, AI-native book that
explores how artificial intelligence moves beyond screens and servers into the
physical world.

This book focuses on **Embodied Intelligence** — systems where perception,
reasoning, and action are tightly coupled inside humanoid robots operating under
real-world physical constraints.

## 🎯 What This Book Is About

Modern AI is no longer just about prediction or text generation. The future of AI
lies in **physical systems** that can:

- Perceive the world through sensors  
- Understand human language and intent  
- Plan actions intelligently  
- Move, navigate, and manipulate objects  

This book bridges the gap between:
- **Digital brains** (LLMs, planners, perception models)
- **Physical bodies** (robots, sensors, actuators, environments)

---

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

By the end of this book, you will understand how to:

- Use **ROS 2** as a robotic nervous system
- Build **digital twins** using Gazebo and Unity
- Train and simulate robots using **NVIDIA Isaac**
- Combine **Vision, Language, and Action (VLA)** into autonomous behavior
- Design AI-native, spec-driven robotics systems
- Build an **autonomous humanoid pipeline** in simulation

## 📘 Book Structure

This book is organized into four modules:

### **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**
Learn how robots communicate, think, and act using ROS 2, Python agents, and URDF.

### **Module 2: The Digital Twin**
Simulate physics, environments, and sensors using Gazebo and Unity.

### **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain**
Train perception and navigation systems using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2.

### **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**
Integrate speech, LLM-based planning, perception, and control into an autonomous
humanoid capstone system.
