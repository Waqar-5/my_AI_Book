# Introduction to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This module, titled "The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)", focuses on understanding ROS 2 as the middleware layer for humanoid robot control and bridging AI agents to physical robot behaviors.

## Target Audience

This module is designed for AI and robotics students/developers with basic Python knowledge. We assume familiarity with fundamental programming concepts and will build upon them to explore ROS 2 concepts.

## Focus Areas

In this module, we will cover:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robots** - Understanding nodes, topics, services, and message flow, as well as real-time communication and modular design
2. **Python Agents and Robot Control with rclpy** - Writing ROS 2 nodes in Python and connecting AI/LLM-driven agents to ROS controllers
3. **Robot Structure and Description with URDF** - Modeling humanoid robots using URDF, including links, joints, sensors, and actuation basics

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you should be able to:
- Explain ROS 2's role as a robotic nervous system
- Create and run basic ROS 2 Python nodes
- Understand how AI agents interface with ROS 2 controllers
- Interpret and modify a humanoid URDF file

## Structure of This Module

This module is organized into three main chapters, each with hands-on exercises and practical examples:

- [ROS 2 Fundamentals for Humanoid Robots](./ros2-fundamentals.md)
- [Python Agents and Robot Control with rclpy](./python-nodes-rclpy.md)
- [Robot Structure and Description with URDF](./urdf-modeling.md)

Each chapter builds upon the previous ones, providing a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 in the context of humanoid robotics.

Let's begin exploring the foundational concepts of ROS 2!
