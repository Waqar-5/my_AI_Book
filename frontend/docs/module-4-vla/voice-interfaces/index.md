# Voice-to-Action Interfaces

This chapter covers the implementation of voice-to-action interfaces for humanoid robots, enabling natural communication through speech commands.

## Overview

Voice interfaces provide a natural and intuitive way for humans to interact with robots. In this module, we'll explore how to implement voice interfaces using OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition and various techniques for mapping voice commands to robot intentions.
