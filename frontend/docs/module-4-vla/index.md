# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for Humanoid Robots

This module covers combining language, perception, and action to enable autonomous humanoid behavior using LLM-driven planning. You'll learn how to integrate AI/robotics students/developers with the Vision-Language-Action paradigm to create systems that can process voice commands, plan using LLMs, and execute actions in a simulated humanoid robot.

## Overview

In this module, you'll learn to create an integrated system that combines:
1. **Voice-to-Action Interfaces**: Processing speech commands using OpenAI Whisper
2. **Cognitive Planning with LLMs**: Translating natural language into ROS 2 action sequences
3. **End-to-End Autonomous Humanoid**: An integrated system with perception, navigation, and manipulation

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system represents a breakthrough in robotics, allowing for more intuitive human-robot interaction and complex task execution through the combination of visual perception, language understanding, and physical action.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the Vision-Language-Action paradigm and its significance in robotics
- Implement voice-to-action interfaces using OpenAI Whisper
- Design cognitive planning systems powered by Large Language Models
- Integrate perception, navigation, and manipulation in simulation

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of Large Language Models
- Understanding of digital twins (covered in Module 2)

## Chapter Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. [Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./voice-interfaces/index) - Covering speech recognition with OpenAI Whisper and mapping voice commands to robot intents
2. Cognitive Planning with LLMs - Explaining how to translate natural language into ROS 2 action sequences and task decomposition
3. End-to-End Autonomous Humanoid - Implementing the complete VLA pipeline with perception, navigation, and manipulation in simulation

Each chapter builds upon the previous one but can also be studied independently depending on your specific interests.
