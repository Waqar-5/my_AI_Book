# Module 2: Terminology Reference

This document defines key terms specific to Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) to ensure consistent use across all chapters. For related terminology from other modules, see the following:

- [Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](/docs/modules/robotic-nervous-system/intro) terminology
- [Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain](/docs/modules/ai-robot-brain/photorealistic-simulation) terminology
- [Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](/docs/modules/vla/intro) terminology

## Core Concepts

- **Digital Twin**: A virtual representation of a physical system that enables simulation, testing, and validation of robot behaviors in a safe, cost-effective virtual environment.
- **Physics Simulation**: The computational modeling of physical properties such as gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics to create realistic robot behaviors.
- **High-Fidelity Visualization**: The rendering of realistic visual representations of simulated environments and robot states using advanced graphics techniques.
- **Humanoid Robot**: A robot with a body structure that mimics human form, including legs, arms, and a head/torso configuration.

## Gazebo-Specific Terms

- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format used to describe robot models, including their kinematic and dynamic properties. For more on URDF modeling, see [Module 1: URDF Modeling](/docs/modules/robotic-nervous-system/urdf-modeling).
- **World File**: A Gazebo-specific file that defines the environment including objects, lighting, and physics properties.
- **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: The underlying format used by Gazebo to describe simulation entities such as robots, sensors, and environments.
- **Gazebo Plugin**: A module that extends Gazebo's functionality, enabling custom sensors, controllers, or other behaviors.

## Unity-Specific Terms

- **Scene**: A Unity container that holds all the objects, environments, and configurations for a specific view or simulation state.
- **Prefab**: A reusable Unity object template that can be instantiated multiple times in different scenes.
- **Asset**: Any media file (models, textures, scripts) used within a Unity project.
- **Script**: Unity code files (typically C#) that control game object behavior and interactions.

## Sensor Simulation Terms

- **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A sensor technology that measures distances by illuminating targets with light and analyzing the reflected light. For detailed configuration, see [LiDAR Simulation](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/sensor-simulation/lidar-simulation).
- **Depth Camera**: A sensor that captures distance information for each pixel in the captured image, creating a 3D representation of the scene. For detailed configuration, see [Depth Camera Simulation](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/sensor-simulation/depth-camera-simulation).
- **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)**: A sensor that measures specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body. For detailed configuration, see [IMU Simulation](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/sensor-simulation/imu-simulation).
- **Point Cloud**: A collection of data points in 3D space, typically generated by LiDAR sensors to represent the environment.

## Integration Terms

- **Synchronization**: The process of ensuring that simulation state is consistently reflected across different simulation environments (Gazebo and Unity). For implementation details, see [Synchronization](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/unity-visualization/synchronization).
- **Real-time**: Systems that process data and respond to changes as they occur, with minimal latency between the source and visualization.
- **State Bridge**: A communication layer that transfers state information between different simulation platforms. For implementation details, see [Unity-Gazebo Integration](/docs/module-2-digital-twin/unity-visualization/unity-gazebo-integration).
- **ROS Integration**: The connection layer between simulation environments and ROS systems for bidirectional communication of robot state and commands. For more on ROS integration, refer to [Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals](/docs/modules/robotic-nervous-system/ros2-fundamentals).
