# Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This module covers creating accurate digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based simulation and high-fidelity environments. You'll learn to build simulated humanoid systems using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization and interaction.

## Overview

Digital twins are virtual representations of physical systems that enable safe testing, validation, and training of robot behaviors before deployment to real hardware. In this module, you'll learn to create digital twins for humanoid robots using:

1. **Gazebo Physics Simulation**: Modeling realistic gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics
2. **Unity Visualization**: Creating high-fidelity visual representations and human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation**: Generating realistic sensor data (LiDAR, depth, IMU) for AI pipelines

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in Physical AI
- Simulate basic humanoid physics in Gazebo
- Understand Unity's role in interaction and visualization within digital twin systems
- Describe simulated sensor data flows and their applications to AI pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments
- Access to Gazebo and Unity for hands-on exercises

## Chapter Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Physics-Based Simulation with Gazebo** - Focuses on gravity, collisions, and rigid-body dynamics
2. **High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity** - Covers visual realism and human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation for Perception** - Details LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMU simulation

Each chapter builds on the previous one, but can also be studied independently depending on your specific interests.
